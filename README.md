# Sokol in a GTK app in Rust

This is an example of using the excellent [Sokol graphics library](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) inside a GTK app.

The project uses GTK3, because the project I’m working on uses GTK3, not 4, sorry.

I am definitely no expert in either GTK or Sokol; this is just a hacked together demo, not necessarily best practices. If you have suggestions for improvement, please submit a PR.
